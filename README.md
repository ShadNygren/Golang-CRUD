# Golang-CRUD

This is simple example of how you can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations in Golang targeting a PostgreSQL database on AWS Aurora.

This example assumes you are familiar with Go's database/sql package and have already set up your PostgreSQL database on AWS Aurora. This code was originally generated using ChatGPT.

First, ensure you have the PostgreSQL driver for Go installed:

  go get -u github.com/lib/pq


Now, here's a basic outline of the CRUD operations in Go:

This example demonstrates basic CRUD operations: creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts. Ensure you have a table named posts with the appropriate structure in your PostgreSQL database.

Regarding documentation, the code is self-explanatory, but you can always add comments to clarify each function's purpose and parameters.

For test cases, you might want to write tests that mock database interactions. This typically involves using an interface for the database and a mocking library like gomock or testify. However, writing these tests is quite extensive and depends heavily on your specific setup and requirements.

Remember to replace <YOUR_DB_HOST>, <YOUR_DB_USER>, <YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>, and <YOUR_DB_NAME> with your actual AWS Aurora database credentials. Also, ensure that your AWS Aurora instance is configured to accept connections from your application's IP address.
